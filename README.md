Project Description

This project focuses on predicting the closing prices of stock market shares using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction. The project utilizes historical stock price data from Alpha Vantage to train and test the model, demonstrating the potential of LSTM networks in financial forecasting.

Key Features:

-Data Collection: Fetches historical stock price data from Alpha Vantage.

-Data Preprocessing: Scales the data using MinMaxScaler and structures it for LSTM input.

-Model Building: Constructs an LSTM model with multiple layers and dropout for regularization.

-Training: Trains the model on historical stock data to learn patterns and trends.

-Prediction: Predicts future stock prices based on the trained model.

-Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices for visual comparison.

Dependencies:

-NumPy

-Pandas

-Pandas DataReader

-Matplotlib

-Scikit-Learn

-TensorFlow

How It Works:

1) Loading Data: The script begins by loading historical stock price data for a specified company (e.g., Apple Inc.) from Alpha Vantage.

2) Data Preparation: The closing prices are scaled and split into training data for the LSTM model.

3) Model Construction: An LSTM model is built with three LSTM layers and dropout layers in between to prevent overfitting.

4) Model Training: The model is trained on the prepared dataset to learn stock price patterns.

5) Prediction and Visualization: The trained model is used to predict stock prices, and the results are plotted to compare actual and predicted values.
